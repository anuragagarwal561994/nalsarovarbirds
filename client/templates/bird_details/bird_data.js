During times when the population is biased towards females a polygynous system is adopted where a monogamous pair may be joined by multiple secondary females.

They are very motile migrating twice a year over the Himalaya Mountains to and from their breeding grounds on the Tibetan-Qinghai Plateau. They migrate in "V"-formations or variations of it. They have a social hierarchy consisting of mated male-female pairs being the highest, followed by secondary females that are usually part of a harem, and lowest socially is lone females. This harem usually forms when the population is biased towards females. Bar-headed geese make ground nests with shallow depressions at high elevations.

The species migratory movements are mainly nocturnal, although diurnal migration is known in the Palearctic. It breeds between May and June in the Northern Hemisphere and nests in reed swamps in small or large colonies of up to 2000 nests. It forages diurnally and is highly gregarious both on migration and during the winter, forming concentrations of hundreds of thousands at certain sites in North America and Asia. After arrival in autumn staging grounds the species becomes flightless for 3 to 4 months due to loss of weight from the pectoral muscles.'

Populations have also been known to crash in winter habitats during ENSO events due to reductions in food availability due to warming sea-surface temperatures, although they afterwards rebound. Local declines of this species are also attributed to human disturbance and it is commonly killed by collisions with power transmission lines.

The birds perform ritualistic displays that include bows, leaps, runs, wing flapping, short flights, jerky bouncing, running, and stick tossing. Cranes of all ages, paired and unpaired, dance. Among younger birds, dancing may serve to reduce aggression with other cranes, provide physical exercise, and possibly relieve anxiety.',

        population_status : 'There were about an estimated 15–20,000 mature sarus cranes left in the wild in 2009. The Indian population is less than 10,000, but of the three subspecies, is the healthiest in terms of numbers. They are considered sacred and the birds are traditionally left unharmed, and in many areas they are unafraid of humans. They used to be found on occasion in Pakistan, but have not been seen there since the late 1980s. The population in India has however declined. Estimates of the global population suggest that the population in 2000 was at best about 10% and at the worst just 2.5% of the numbers that existed in 1850. Many farmers in India believe that these cranes damage standing crops, particularly rice, although studies show that direct feeding on rice grains resulted in losses amounting to less than one percent and trampling could account for grain loss of about 0.4–15 kilograms (0.88–33.07 lb).',
